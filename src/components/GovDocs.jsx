        <h1 className="text-l mt-5 "> <strong>What is the Coffee Club DAO?</strong> </h1>
        <p>Although we are not affiliated with the Princeton University Coffee Club in any way, the Coffee Club
           DAO is an application of the concepts and principles of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) 
           to a social setting using Coffee Club as an example. Typically, DAOs are used for decentralized 
           governance related to a particular Web3 token. Members can join by contributing a certain amount 
           of this token and make decisions by raising and voting on proposals. Once a proposal is passed,
            the creator of the proposal is given funds to enact the change they believe to be necessary. 
            All information, including expired proposals and voter decisions, are stored within the DAO 
            to increase transparency. <br></br><br></br>

            While the Coffee Club DAO uses similar principles, it primarily focuses on community engagement, 
            as opposed to economic decision making. Instead of governing a particular token, the Coffee Club DAO 
            is used to govern the social aspects of Coffee Club. What menu items should be available, what artists 
            should perform, and many more decisions can be made communally using the DAO. While any individual 
            can raise a proposal, no funds are paid out to the proposer, but instead funds are used by the 
            Coffee Club to put the particular proposals into action. In its essence, the Coffee Club DAO is a 
            social experiment, supplemented with Web3 technology and principles.

        <h1 className="text-l mt-5 "> <strong>Why was the Coffee Club DAO made?</strong> </h1>
        <p>The Coffee Club DAO was created to drive community engagement around Coffee Club. 
          Join the DAO to propose new drink flavors, request open mic performers, and shape 
          the future of Coffee Club. By blending art, commerce, community, and of course coffee, 
          the Coffee Club DAO is a model for the social DAO: a digital blockchain community focused 
          on togetherness, rather than spending. The future of coffee is digital– <em>join the Coffee Club DAO!</em></p>

        <h1 className="text-l mt-5 "> <strong>How to use the Coffee Club DAO:</strong> </h1>
        <p>This DAO is meant to simulate the “punch card” process of the Princeton University Coffee Club. 
          In the real world, after you buy 10 coffees at Coffee Club, you fill a punch card and get your next
          coffee for free. In this DAO, we follow a similar incentive logic to both encourage coffee purchases 
          and DAO engagement. Instead of receiving a free coffee after the 10th coffee purchase, you are given 
          a Coffee Club NFT. This Coffee Club NFT can then be used as a token to create and vote on proposals 
          in the DAO. By contributing 1 Coffee Club NFT to the DAO, you unlock the ability to create proposals 
          for the DAO as well as vote on any active DAO proposals. <br/><br/>

          To contribute to the DAO, use the “contribute” button on the home page. You must contribute at least 
          1 Coffee Club NFT, although you can contribute more. The more NFTs you contribute, the more voting 
          power you hold. <br/><br/>

          To create a proposal, use the “propose” button on the home page, which appears once you have 
          contributed at least 1 Coffee Club NFT. Fill in the fields with your proposal title, your 
          public wallet address, and a description of your proposal. Click “submit” to publish this 
          proposal to the DAO. <br/><br/>

          To vote on proposals, you can view each proposal listed on the home page by clicking the 
          “view” button. You will be brought to a proposal-specific page, where you can cast your 
          vote on the topic by selecting “Accept” or “Reject.” <br/><br/>
